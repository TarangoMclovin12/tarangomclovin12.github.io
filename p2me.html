            <p>Hello! My name is Travis James Tarango and I'm a 17 year old school boy who currently lives in Redlands and goes to Citrus Valley High where I learn stuff and things. I also play on the varsity baseball team where I am one of the few prodegies of the one and only Daren Espinoza who is an all knowing Demi-God. Outside of school I am pretty active and do many physical activities but I also spend some free time playing various video games or watching movies. I wish i was more musically inclined because my passion for all generes of music is as vast as possible. I plan to learn all things from the dewy decimal system to surfing mavericks. As far as future goals go my longest term mission is to wake up tomorrow because I am more the type of individual who lives in the moment. If you've read this far you've made it on the good noodle board and I sincerly thank you and hope you continue to explore my website.</p>
